# Grammars (WIP)

This chapter will discuss PEGs in general, then fully describe the syntax of
`pest` grammars, including special rules.

This chapter overview page will have a brief summary of language grammars,
followed by instructions for invoking the `pest` derive macro (the `#[derive]`
and `#[grammar]` attributes, and the explanation of `include_str!`).
